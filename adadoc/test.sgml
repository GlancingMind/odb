<chapter id="getstarted"><?dbhtml filename="getstarted.html">
<title>Getting started</title>
<para>
The ASCL project distribution is currently distributed only as 
development snapshot, which means the packages do not contains
any binary files. There for before starting make sure that you 
have all required tools (see release notes ./doc/releasenotes). 
</para>
<para>
The development package contains the sources for all platforms
so far supported. ASCL support the two major platforms Windows NT
and Unix/Linux. The following sections are describing the 
installation steps for both platforms.
</para>
<sect1>
   <title>Installation on Unix like systems</title>
   <para>
   After you  obtained the source code from the net you 
   need to install and compile it. This chapter describes
   this first steps of installing the environment onto 
   your system.
   </para>

   <sect2>
   <title>Unpacking the distribution</title>
   <para>
   The source code is normally distributed as compressed tar 
   file. To unpack the distribution execute the command:
   <programlisting>
      gunzip -c | tar xvf -
   </programlisting> 
   This will unpack the directory tree of the development 
   environment. 
   </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
   <title>Configuring the ASCL installation</title>
   <para>
   The ASCL environment may be configured to a certain extend. The file 
   make.conf.in contains some parameters which might be adopted to the 
   needs of your system.
   </para>
   <para>
   After unpacking the distribution change into the top level directory 
   of the ASCL release. Before you run the configure script examine the 
   contents of the file etc/config.site. 
   </para>
   <programlisting>
site_bindir="/usr/bin"
site_libdir="/usr/lib"
site_adadir="/usr/lib/ada"
   </programlisting>
   <para>
   After configuring the correct values runf the configure script
   in the root directory of the source distribution.
   <programlisting>

       cd ascl-src-....
       ./configure      

   </programlisting>
   </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
   <title>Compiling the distribution</title>
   <para>
   To build the ASCL executable enter the command below:
   <programlisting>
   make all
   </programlisting>
   This will build all components of the ASCL project and the 
   test data base is this has not been done previously.
   </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
   <title>Installing ASCL globally on the system</title>
   <para>
   The development environment is self containing, which means 
   as long as applications are developed in the directory where
   ASCL is installed and the make files are used, all components
   are taken from the ASCL lib directory. This method limits the 
   use to one user. In order to make ASCL available to all users
   on your system you need to install the ASCL libraries. Installation
   is done as root by executing the directory ../gnuada/gnade the 
   following command:
   </para>
   <programlisting>
      make install
   </programlisting>
   <para>
   This should install the libraries of the ASCL project in 
   your system. 
   </para>
   </sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
   <title>Installation on Windows NT</title>
   <para>
    Building the ASCL project for Windows NT does not require 
    the configuration step as for Linux. The preconfigured 
    Makefiles are located in the ./win32 directory.
   </para>

   <sect2>
   <title>Unpacking the distribution</title>
   <para>
   The source code is normally distributed as ZIP file, which is
   easy to unpack by means of Windows utilities as e.g WinZip. From
   the DOS command line use:
   <programlisting>
      unzip gnade-src-arch-version.zip
      cd gnade-src-arch-version 
   </programlisting> 
   This will unpack the directory tree of the development 
   environment. 
   </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
   <title>Compiling the distribution</title>
   <para>
   As for Unix the compilation process is based upon the 
   execution of a Makefile. In order to compile the distribution
   perform the following commands:
   <programlisting>
      cd win32
      make 
   </programlisting>
   </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
   <title>Installation on your system</title>
   <para>
   An automatic and configurable procedure has not been yet
   developed. 
   </para>
   </sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
   <title>General Installation Hints</title>
   <sect2>
      <title>Using Emacs with ASCL</title>
      <para>
      The ASCL project uses several file extension which are 
      not commonly defined in the emacs default configuration.
      As a consequence syntax high ligthing is not activated. In order 
      to activate syntax highlighting again the following lines
      have to be added to to .emacs file in your home directory:
      </para>
      <programlisting>
  (setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.C$"  . c++-mode)
                ("\\.cc$" . c++-mode)
                ("\\.hh$" . c++-mode)
                ("\\.adq$" . ada-mode)
                ("\\.gpq$" . ada-mode)
                ("\\.gpb$" . ada-mode)
                ("\\.c$"  . c-mode)
                ("\\.h$"  . c-mode))
              auto-mode-alist))
