This is the Ada Build Environment (ABE). It provides processes
for the following tasks:

- Documentation based on inline documentation
- Building a version for local test
- Building a source and binary distribuition
- Building rpm files for source and binary distributions


The build results are stored localy in the directories:

   <arch>-lib
   <arch>-bin
   <arch>-include
   <arch>-install


Installation
============
This is the source release of the package which means before 
using the package you need to recompile the library and install
it on your system.

Step 0 - Unpacking the release
  gunzip -c adadba-src-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -


Step 1 - Configuration

  Check the correct settings in etc/site.conf.
  Run the configure utility

   ./configure


Step 2 - Compile

  Execute in the installation directory the following 
  command(s):

  gmake

Step 4 - Generate Documentation

  gmake documentation

  The documentation will be located under doc.

Step 5 - Systemwide installation

  su - ....
  gmake install


Using ABE
=========

The directory tree looks like this

./adadoc        -- location of the ada doc utility
./autoconf	-- directory with the configuration code
./base		-- components of the abe environment
./bin		-- executable used by the abe environment
./etc		-- some site specific configuration files
./pkg-config	-- files for the GNU pkg-config utility
./rpm		-- files for the rpm utility
./doc		-- documentation, including application documentation
./apps		-- place where the user of ABE is putting his applications
./samples	-- some samples of the user application
./src		-- application library source code 
./util		-- utility library
